* What is it and how it affects us?

- [[https://www.rtpbleed.com][The RTP bleed ]] intially made public by [[https://twitter.com/sandrogauci][Sandro Gauci]] and [[https://github.com/kapejod][Klaus-Peter Junghanns]]
- Allows almost anyone to redirect media streams.
- Cannot be mitigated in 100% cases

* POTS RTP bleed

* Why it was introduced in the first place?

- Lots of legacy with poor security
- We have to deal with NAT somehow

* RTP proxying

- Multiple implementations
- Most simple case - there are more (transcoding, etc).
- RTP proxy is visible to both callers
- RTP proxy allocateis ports and resends data to calling parties
- Who actually sends data to these ports? The same question as in POTS.

* Avoid RTP proxying with STUN?

- No.

* RTP structure

- That's all we have.

* SRTP structure

- Extends RTP with authentication

* What can we do to mitigate it using current architecture?

- In short - we can't do much
- Remembering last IP? Doesn't work with 4G networks
- SSRC also could change although this looks to be rare
- No signature of any kind
- Even if possible to "sign" (SRTP), then what to do with legacy devices?

* Will future Voice / Video over IP systems be affected?

- IPv6
- ***Encryption** (SRTP + MIKEY, ZRTP, SDES, DTLS-SRTP)
